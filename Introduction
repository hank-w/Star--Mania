# Star--Mania
#This is my first time uploading code on Github, apologies if there are any bugs or issues.In the case of a bug, you can also view the code 
and play the game here: 

http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_puM22L2lqw_4.py (Please view using Chrome web browser).

I made this game using Python on codeskulptor as a way to learn Python. I was inspiried to make this game when I read about Elon Musk's
story of his first successful videogame, Blastar, which he made at the age of twelve and sold to a local game store in South Africa.

I will be uploading my latest programming project soon, a version of minesweeper with all the features from the original, along with custom maps
and features. I built this version of minesweeper using Java on the Netbeans IDE this year. Please check it out when I release it :).
