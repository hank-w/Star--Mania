# Star--Mania
#This is my first large programming project that I've done, and also my first time uploading code on Github, apologies if there are any 
bugs or issues. In the case of a bug, you can also view the code and play the game here:http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user46_puM22L2lqw_3.py I made this game in grade 11 using python on codeskulptor. I was inspiried to make this game when I read about Elon Musk's
story of his first successful videogame, Blastar, which he made at the age of twelve and sold to a local game store in South Africa.
