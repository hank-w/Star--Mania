# Star--Mania
#This is my first large programming project that I've done, and also my first time uploading code on Github, apologies if there are any 
#bugs or issues. I made this game in grade 11 using python on codeskulptor. I was inspiried to make this game when I read about Elon Musk's
#story of his first successful videogame, Blastar, which he made at the age of twelve and sold to a local game store in South Africa.
